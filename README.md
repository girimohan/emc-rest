# Election Machine Project Overview

## Project Scope
This college project involved the collaborative development of Election Machine software for an imaginary client, with our teachers acting as the clients specifically for the web services part of the module. The project was executed in a team of three members, with each member making equal contributions.
The primary goal was to implement four upper-level features:

1. **Admin Functionality:**
   - Add, edit, and remove candidates.

2. **Admin Functionality:**
   - Add, edit, and remove questions (statements).

3. **Candidate Functionality:**
   - Answer questions and edit/delete their answers.

4. **End User Functionality:**
   - Answer questions and view candidate(s) that best match their answers for an informed voting decision.

## Technology Stack

The Election Machine was required to be implemented as a browser-based application using RESTful technology. The user interface was developed using JavaServer Pages (JSP). The technology stack included:

- RESTful web services technology (using servlets).
- JSP for the view in the MVC architecture.
- Database programming using Java Persistence API (JPA).

The focus was on creating a functional prototype that met the specified requirements and was presented during the review meeting at the end of the project period.
